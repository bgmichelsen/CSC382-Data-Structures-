## CSC382 (Data Structures)

This is all the class work for my CSC382 - Data Structures course.

The class had us create several different data structures in our language of choice (my implementations are in C++). Below are the data structures implemented:
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Hash Table

In addition, we had to implement sorting algorithms on our Linked List and test a known graph library to see the various algorithms for graphs. 
We also learned Big-O notation and how to find the Big-O of a program.
